    <h2>Build an application where, when a user clicks on the screen, a 'brick' is created at that x and y location, 
        and falls down to the bottom of the screen at a speed of 5 pixels / frame.There can be multiple bricks in this 
        application, so you will need to use two arrays and a loop to draw all of the bricks.</h2>
