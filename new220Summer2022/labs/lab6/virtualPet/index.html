    <h2>Virtual Pet</h2>

    <p>Create an application  with an object that represent a virtual pet - similar to a Tamagotchi. Give this pet properties for name, energy, happiness, and age. Include two buttons (and functions) for feeding and playing with the pet - increasing the pet's energy by 5 when fed, and increasing its happiness by 5 when played with. Display these stats on the document: Name, happiness, and energy. They must update every time you change the properties.
        Consider using a function to update the document so you are not repeating yourself across two functions.</p>

        <button id= "feeding" onclick = "feedMoe()">feed!</button>
        <button id= "playing" onclick = "playWithMoe()">play!</button>  
        <button id= "growth" onclick = "growthMoe()">grow!</button>

        <div id= "hambre"></div>
        <div id= "happiness"></div>
        <div id= "age"></div>
