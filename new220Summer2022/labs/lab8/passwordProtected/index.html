    <p>Create an application with two input fields and one button.

        When the button is clicked, verify the user has written these (exact) strings in the first and second field:
        
        First field should be  "Username"
        Second field should be  "Password"
        If the two fields match, update a DIV on the page with the text "Success" or else "Wrong information".
        
        For this assignment: use only one if statement to to the check.
        
        Remember you'll need to use the double-equals (==) to check for equality, and the double-ampersand to check if two things are true.
        
        if( (oneThingIsTrue) && (anotherThingIsTrue) ) {
        
         
        
        }</p>
